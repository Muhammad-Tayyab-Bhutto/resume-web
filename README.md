# React Starter Template for Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a set of ESLint rules. You can choose between two official plugins to enhance your development experience:

1. `@vitejs/plugin-react` - Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
2. `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` - Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Features

- **React:** Get started with React for building modern web applications.
- **Vite:** Enjoy the benefits of Vite's fast development server and bundler.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** See your changes instantly reflected in the browser without a full page reload.
- **ESLint:** Ensure code consistency and maintainability with built-in ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or use it as a template for your project.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Muhammad-Tayyab-Bhutto/resume-web.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

### Usage

Choose the React plugin that suits your needs:

- For Babel-based Fast Refresh:
  ```bash
  vite-plugin-react
  ```

- For SWC-based Fast Refresh:
  ```bash
  vite-plugin-react-swc
  ```

Add your React components in the `src` directory and start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

Your React application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Linting

ESLint is set up with sensible default rules. You can configure ESLint to meet your project's specific requirements by editing the `.eslintrc.js` file.

Run ESLint to check your code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

or

```bash
yarn lint
```

### Build for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

Your optimized production-ready code will be in the `dist` directory.
